## Intent

This is an example project to demonstrate some of the features of ragie.ai's [python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/ragie/).

## Getting Started

First provide your ragie api key by creating .env file with the following env variable:
`RAGIE_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>`

This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a pacakge manager. Install it if you haven't already.

```bash
poetry install
poetry run test
```
